# DOCS

We keep all important docs in `.context/` folder and keep updating them. Structure:

- **System**: Document the current state of the system (project structure, tech stack, integration points, database schema, and core functionalities such as agent architecture, LLM Layer, etc.)
- **Subject**: Details regarding the context of the project, usually involving, such as project details, target audience, content details etc.
- **SOP**: Best practices of execute certain tasks (e.g. how to add a component, etc.)
- **README.md**: An index of all the documentations we have so people know what & where to look for things

We should always update `.context/` docs after we implement certain feature, to make sure it fully reflects the up to date information.

**Before you plan any implementation, always read the `.context/README.md` first to get context.**
